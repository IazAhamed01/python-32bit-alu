32-BIT ALU SIMULATOR USING PYTHON
ABSTRACT

This project presents the design and implementation of a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) simulator using Python. The simulator performs arithmetic, logical, and shift operations based on user-selected opcodes. It also generates processor-style status flags such as Zero, Sign, Carry, and Overflow. A menu-driven interface enables interactive execution, making the system suitable for educational purposes and CPU architecture demonstrations.

OBJECTIVES

To simulate the working of a 32-bit ALU

To implement arithmetic, logical, and shift operations

To understand two’s complement arithmetic

To generate processor condition flags

To design a menu-driven ALU simulator

SYSTEM OVERVIEW

An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a core component of a CPU that performs arithmetic and logical operations. In this project, the ALU is simulated in software using Python, while preserving hardware-like behavior through bit masking and flag generation.

OPERATIONS IMPLEMENTED

ADD (Addition)

SUB (Subtraction)

AND (Logical AND)

OR (Logical OR)

XOR (Logical XOR)

SHL (Shift Left)

SHR (Shift Right)

All operations are restricted to 32-bit signed integers.

STATUS FLAGS
Flag	Description
Z	Zero flag – result equals zero
S	Sign flag – MSB is 1
C	Carry flag – carry out occurred
V	Overflow flag – signed overflow
WORKING PRINCIPLE

User selects an operation via numeric menu

Operands A and B are entered

Operation is executed based on opcode

Result is masked to 32 bits

Flags are generated

Output is displayed
TESTING & RESULTS

Example: Input: ADD, A=10, B=5 Output: Result=15, Flags Z=0, S=0, C=0, V=0

Overflow Case: Input: ADD, A=2147483647, B=1 Output: Result=-2147483648

CONCLUSION

The 32-bit ALU simulator successfully emulates CPU-level arithmetic and logical operations using Python. The project enhanced understanding of low-level computation, bit manipulation, and processor flag logic. The simulator is suitable for academic demonstrations and further extensions.

FUTURE SCOPE

Multiplication and division operations

GUI-based interface

Pipelined ALU simulation
