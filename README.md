# 32-bit ALU Simulation using Python

This project simulates a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Python.
It performs arithmetic and logical operations based on opcode input.
The project demonstrates CPU-like behavior through software simulation.


CONCEPT:
In hardware, ALUs operate on fixed-width binary numbers.
To simulate a 32-bit ALU in Python, bit masking is used to limit results to 32 bits.
Signed numbers are represented using two’s complement notation.
